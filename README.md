# Welance

Welance is a platform for businesses to hire certified freelance developers on a project basis. Because it requires developers to provide proof of qualification upon registration it ensures quality of the final product for the businesses hiring the developer. Through this we overcome some of the major issues associated with freelance websites such as Fiverr. At the moment it is mainly aimed at alumni from Le Wagon.

## About

It was built as a final project as part of the Le Wagon coding bootcamp. Welance was coded with Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The website is available at https://welance.xyz
